Introduction

The Automated Precipitation Correction Program (APCP) is developed to remove mechanical noise signals from the precipitation data measured using weighing-recording precipitation gauges. The APCP program is available for download from http://earth.boisestate.edu/apcp/. This data set contains a sample input file 2008wr006875-txts01.txt for the precipitation data collected using shielded universal weighing-recording precipitation gauge during the year 2002 at a site (Site ID: 174) located in Reynolds Creek Experimental Watershed, Idaho. By default APCP generates output data file following the time steps of input data file (2008wr006875-txts02.txt) but continuous time series data at any user specified interval (such as 15-min, 1 hour etc) can be generated by selecting 'Fixed Interval (min)' option. Hourly output time series data for the above input file is presented in 2008wr006875-txts03.txt.

Selection of User-Defined Parameters

User-defined parameters should be selected based on careful observation of raw data and field maintenance records. Guidelines for selection of user-defined parameters are discussed in the manuscript. User-defined parameters used to process the example data presented here are: BucketDecanting Limit = 6.25 mm, BucketRecharge Limit = 50 mm, Noise Limit = 2.5 mm and Out of Range Data Value = -17777 mm (-6999 in). 

Limitations

APCP may not remove all noise satisfactorily when the amplitude of noise caused by site maintenance and/or instrument malfunctioning is smaller than the low amplitude noise signals. These errors should be removed manually from the raw precipitation records before using APCP. Though APCP is capable of filling data gaps (by linear interpolation), it is not recommended to fill data gaps larger than 1 or 2 days or for the periods during which substantial precipitation may have occurred.

1. 2008wr006875-ds01.txt
Input data file contains space separated columns of Julian day, Time (2 digits of hour and 2 digits of minute, for example 1330 indicates 1:30 PM) and measured gauge-catch (mm). 	

2. 2008wr006875-ds02.txt
Output data file contains space separated columns of Julian day, Time and APCP corrected gauge catch (mm) at time step similar to input data file. 

3. 2008wr006875-ds03.txt
Output data file contains space separated columns of Julian day, Time and APCP corrected gauge catch (mm) at hourly time step.
